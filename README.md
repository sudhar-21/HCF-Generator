HCF-Generator 
The HCF, also known as the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), represents the largest positive integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. In Verilog, we can design an efficient HCF generator module. By leveraging algorithms like Euclidâ€™s method, we calculate the HCF of input numbers. The Verilog code ensures clock domain independence and resource efficiency.
